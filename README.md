This is MMDB, an interface that uses TMDB's API to dipslay information about movies, television shows, and celebrities.  Note, this is still a work in progress.

To run the application, you will need flutter installed, then simply open VSCode, or another editor if you prefer, and run with F5, or the run command for flutter in another editor.  In the future, I am planning on adding an easier way to run the program, but for now this is all I have.
